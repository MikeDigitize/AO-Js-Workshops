        /*
        Programming JavaScript -

        Writing in a text file - your source code - to give a computer instructions on what to do.
        The computer can't directly understand your code - it needs to get compiled down into language the
        computer does understand,
        ultimately machine code, binary, 1s and 0s.
        The source code is not for the computer's benefit - it is for yours.
        It's meant to be readable to humans.

        JavaScript is the only programming language that's native to the web browser.
        That means EVERY web browser supports JavaScript and has since the very early days of the internet,
        from the time since the days of the Netscape 2 and Internet Explorer 3 browsers.

        The browser supports other programming languages,
        but they have to be installed as plugins - Flash, Java, Sliverlight etc.
        They do not run natively in the browser and are all but phased out now anyway.
        So JavaScript has the monopoly. There is no competition from other programming languages.

        So if you want your website to do anything beyond display web pages, you need to instruct it to do so in JavaScript.

        Learning a programming language requires a new way of thinking.
        It requires getting into the mindset of the language context.

        JavaScript runs in other contexts than the browser.
        It runs on servers, in robots, in appliances and many other things.
        But most relevantly here, it runs in the browser.
        So writing instructions for the browser requires thinking in the context of the browser.
        And the context is ultimately websites, the internet, the browser itself and the device it runs on.

        The context of the browser means thinking about all the things the browser both has access to and can do,
        think about the ability to access and manipulate every part of a web page - every word, image, link and so on,
        think about the ability to use the internet and send and receive information to and from other websites and services,
        think about accessing browser related information such as your browser history, cookies or the address bar.
        JavaScript has the ability to do all these things.

        Web browsers also provide a ton of additional services that can create -
        audio, video, animations, 3d models, access battery life, bluetooth, geolocation of users etc...
        plus much, much more.
        JavaScript can access and utilise all these things too,
        so your mindset should be writing software to take advantage of all these services and this information.

        This may be something like writing a program to do something as simple as responding to when a user clicks something,
        such as when you like a post on Facebook or Twitter,
        or something as complex as allowing a user to make a purchase online,
        or something as common as giving access to multimedia such as video or music,
        or something as useful as providing a service such as travel information or geographical information.

        It is making use of all the wonderful things possible in the browser and the internet.

        When JavaScript is included in a context, such as the browser or the server,
        they are known as its host environment.
        The host environment provides hooks for JavaScript to tap into it and access its information and utilise its services.
        These hooks are collectively known as an API - Application Programming Interface.

        Think of Facebook.
        Think how websites can display how many likes their Facebook page has.
        Think how websites allow you to share their content on Facebook.
        Think about all the other Facebook related stuff you see aroud the internet,
        that utilise data or services from Facebook.

        This is because Facebook has numerous APIs.
        These APIs allow you to tap into their data and use their services.
        There is a Facebook JavaScript API to allow websites to utilise this data and these services.

        NodeJS which is server side JavaScript is the same thing.
        It has an API that exposes its data and services to JavaScript.
        A server's data and services are obviously different to those of a browser.
        NodeJS's API allows JavaScript to access many server related things,
        such as its file system, network connections and databases.

        The browser is the same thing.
        It has an API that exposes its data and services to JavaScript.
        The browser's API is known as the DOM API - the Document Object Model.
        Back in the early days browsers were used originally to access documents.
        Document is interchangeable for web page which is a document made up of HTML.

        HTML is how documents are described to the browser.
        This is a paragraph. This is an image. This is a video. This is a link etc etc.
        If something is a link for example, the browser knows to jump to the web page it links to when its clicked.
        The DOM represents the structure of a web page's HTML,
        and the API allows JavaScript access to it and all the functionality it supports.

        Learning to write JavaScript is just like learning a new spoken language -
        at first very little will probably make sense.
        But JavaScript is, as languages go, one of the most readable.
        Programming languages, like spoken language, have syntax, grammar and punctuation.
        These things collectively make statements.
        Your source code is just a collection of statements that collectively achieve an outcome
        with lots of quirks and nuances, just like every spoken language.

        Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("link, style")).forEach(item => item.parentNode.removeChild(item));
